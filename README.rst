Chessington
===========

Starter project for a chess-based TDD exercise.

Running the application
-----------------------

To run the application, first ensure that you have installed Poetry_ on your system. Install
dependencies using the command ``poetry install``.

To run the application, use the command ``poetry run start``. This will pop up a window containing
a chess board. Clicking on one of the white pieces will highlight the square that piece is on,
and also show you the squares it can move to. Except...

None of the rules of chess have been implemented yet! That's your job :)

Running the tests
-----------------

To run the tests, use the command ``poetry run pytest tests``. This will run any test defined in a function
matching the pattern ``test_*`` or ``*_test``, in any file matching the same patterns, in the ``tests`` directory.

GUI Dependencies
----------------

The application runs a desktop GUI using Tkinter. If you're running an official Python distribution, this will just
work out of the box.

Users relying on third-party Python installations (e.g. Mac/Linux system installs, package managers) may need to configure
Tcl/Tk separately, or download an official Python distribution for use on this codebase.

Mac users can check out https://www.python.org/download/mac/tcltk/ for further details.

Notes for WSL users
-------------------

Sadly, WSL does not support GUIs, so this application will not work from a WSL terminal. Sorry :(
